*******************************************************************************

    - Region is publicly location in the world
    - AZ (availability zone) - one or more discrete DCs witch with redundant
      power; networking / connectivity ... etc.

    - Edge location - endpoints for AWS which are used for caching
      content.Typically this consist of CloudFront , Amazon CDN (Content
      Delivery Network)

*******************************************************************************
*                  Section 3: IAM Identity Access Management                  *
*******************************************************************************
 IAM allows you to manage users and their rights to the AWS Console
    - centralised control
    - shared access to your AWS account
    - granular permission
    - identity federation (AD/facebook/linkedin...)
    - multifactor auth
    - provide temporary access
    - password rotation policy
    - integrates with many AWS services
    - PCI DSS Compliance

 Terminology
    - Users
    - Groups
    - Plicies   - json files with permissions for user/groups
    - Roles     - create rolea and assign it to AWS resources


****************
*  8. IAM Lab  *
****************
    - create user group via gui 
    - create S3_Admin_access Role and assign it to the user
    - create MFA with Auth app

    - IAM is universal

*  10. S3 (Simple Storage Service)  *
*************************************
 S3 - secure, durable, highly-scalable Object based storage 

 - S3 data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
 - object based
 - files can be between 0 and 5T
 - unlimited storage
 - files are stored in buckets
 - S3 is universal namespace (bucket names must be unique globally)
 - Example of S3: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucket_name>
 - when you upload a file to s3 successful your HTTP response code will be 200

 S3 Objects is consist of the following:
    - key       - name of the object
    - value     - data 
    - versionID - important for versioning 
    - metadata  - "data about data" ;)
    - sub resources:
        - ACL (access control list)
        - Torrents 

 Data Consistency Model for S3
    - Read after Write for PUTS of new objects
    - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time
      to propagate ) 

 S3 Guarantees:
    - build for 99.99$ Availability
    - Amazon guarantees 99.9% availability
    - Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (11x9)

 S3 Futures:
    - Tiered Storage Available
    - Lifecycle Management
    - Versioning
    - Encrypt 
    - MFA to Delete an object
    - ACL 

 S3 Classes:
    - S3 standard (99.99% availability / 11x9 - durability). Designed to
      sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
    - S3-IA (infrequently access) - lower fee than S3 but you are charged a
      retrieval fee.
    - S3 One Zone IA (formally known as RRS - reduce redundancy storage ) -for
      infrequently accessed data but you don't want multiple availability zones
      data resilience
    - S3 Intelligent Tiering - Designed to optimize costs by automatically to
      the most cost effective access tier without operational/performance
      impact (used for ML)
    - S3 Glacier - for data archiving. reliably store any data at costs that
      are competitive with or cheaper that on-premises solutions. Retrieval
      times configurable from minutes to hous
    - S3 Glacier Deep Archive - lowest cost storage class with retrieval times
      more than 12 hours

 S3 Charges:
    - per Storage
    - per Request
    - Storage management pricing 
    - Data Transfer Pricing
    - Transfer Acceleration
    - Cross Region Replication Pricing

NOTE: S3 is Not suitable for installing operating system or db :)) !!



*******************************
*  11. Let's Create S3 - Lab  *
*******************************

************************************
*  12. S3 Security and Encryption  *
************************************
 By default all s3 buckets are Private. You can control access to s3 by
setting:
    - Bucket Policies
    - ACL
 Encryption in transit is secured by SSL/TLS protocols.
 Encryption at Rest (server side) is achieved by:
    - S3 Management Keys - SSE-S3 (service side encryption - s3)
    - AWS key management service - SSE-KMS
    - Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C 
 Client side encryption 
    - encrypt your file/object before upload it on s3

***********************
*  13. S3 Versioning  *
***********************
 - great backup tool
 - once enabled, versioning can't be disable only suspended
 - integrates with lifecycle rules
 - you can use MFA in order to Delete in a secure way.

******************************************
*  14. S3 Lifecycle Management - S3 Lab  *
******************************************
Create Lifecycle Rule with gui:
 S3 > bucket_name > Management > Lifecycle

With Lifecycle rules you can:
 - automates moving your storage to different storage tiers.
 - can be used in conjunction in versioning
 - can be applied to current version and previous versiosns

**********************************
*  15. Cross Region Replication  *
**********************************
Create replication:
 S3 > bucket_name > Management > Replication

 - CRR requires bucket versioning
 - regions must be unique
 - files in the existing bucket is not auto replicated, new ones does.
 - all subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
 - if you delete one file in the bucket the Replicated one is not deleted
   (delete markers are not replicated)
 - deleting individual versions or markers will not be replicated

**********************************
*  16. S3 Transfer Acceleration  *
**********************************

 - utilize CloudFront (AWS CDN) to accelerate your uploads to s3
 - check your speed to CloudFront to different regions with:
http://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html

*****************************
*  17. CloudFront Overview  *
*****************************
 AWS CDN (content delivery network) - distributed cache 

CloudFront - key terminology:
 - Edge Location - location that cache will be stored. This is separate to an
   AWS Region/AZ. You can use Edge Location to write it too!!!
 - Origin - origin of all objects stored in the CDN. They can be stored at: S3,
   bucket, EC2 Instance, Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53
 - Distribution - the name given the CDN which consist of a collection of Edge
   Locations
 - Web Distribution - used for websites
 - RTMP - used for media streaming
 - Objects are cached for a given time (TTL)

Note: You can clear cache in the CloudFront but you'll be charged 


******************
*  19. Snowball  *
******************
 A petabyte-scale data transport solution.
 - 50TB and 80TB variants. It has 256-AES cryptography enabled
 - Snowball Edge is 100TB  data transfer device with onboard storage and
   compute capabilities.
 - Snowmobile - up to 100PB shipping container.

NOTE: Snowball can Import/Export from/to S3


*************************
*  21. Storage Gateway  *
*************************
 AWS Storage Gateway connects on-premises software appliances with cloud based
storage.
    - AWS SG can be installed on Vmware or Hyper-V in your DC
    - After activation you can use it from AWS Management Console

 Types of AWS Storage Gateway:
    - File Gateway      - NFS & SMB
    - Volume Gateway    - iSCSI
        - Stored volumes - store entire data in your DC locally but async
          backup via iSCSI to S3 in the form of Amazon Elastic Block Store
          (Amazon EBS)
        - Cached volumes - store frequently used data in your Storage GW 
    - Tape Gateway      - VTL (Virtual Tape Library )

Note: Read FAQ for S3 before exam :)


*************
*  Quiz 2   *
*************
Question 6: "In what language are policy document written ?" :))))
                - python
                - json          <--- :)))) program language ?
                - node.js
                - java


 question 19: 
    You run a meme creation website where users can create memes and
then download them for use on their own sites. The original images are stored
in S3 and each meme's metadata in DynamoDB. You need to decide upon a low-cost
storage option for the memes, themselves. If a meme object is unavailable or
lost, a Lambda function will automatically recreate it using the original file
from S3 and the metadata from DynamoDB. Which storage solution should you use
to store the non-critical, easily reproducible memes in the most cost-effective
way?
    - s3
    - s3 IA
    - s3 One zone IA <--
    - s3 RRS
    - glacier

S3 – OneZone-IA is the recommended storage for when you want cheaper storage
for infrequently accessed objects. It has the same durability but less
availability. There can be cost implications if you use it frequently or use it
for short lived storage. Glacier is cheaper, but has a long retrieval time. RRS
has effectively been deprecated. It still exists but is not a service that AWS
want to sell anymore.



Question 25:
 What is the availability of S3 – OneZone-IA?
    - 99.90%
    - 99.50% <--- it may be less than S3 or S3-IA ....
    - 99.99%
    - 100%

Question 26:

One of your users is trying to upload a 7.5GB file to S3. However, they keep
getting the following error message: "Your proposed upload exceeds the maximum
allowed object size.". What solution to this problem does AWS recommend?
 
    - design your app to use multipart upload api for all objects

Question 29:

You work for a major news network in Europe. They have just released a new
mobile app that allows users to post their photos of newsworthy events in
real-time, which are then reviewed by your editors before being copied to your
website and made public. Your organization expects this app to grow very
quickly, essentially doubling its user base each month. The app uses S3 to
store the images, and you are expecting sudden and sizable increases in traffic
to S3 when a major news event takes place (as users will be uploading large
amounts of content.) You need to keep your storage costs to a minimum, and it
does not matter if some objects are lost. With these factors in mind, which
storage media should you use to keep costs as low as possible?

    - S3 - infrequently accessed storage
    - S3 - One Zone infrequent Access       <---- the answer
    - S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage
    - Glacier
    - S3 - Provisioned IOPS

Explanation Question 29:

The key driver here is cost, so an awareness of cost is necessary to answer
this. Full S3 is quite expensive at around $0.023 per GB for the lowest band.
S3 standard IA is $0.0125 per GB, S3 One-Zone-IA is $0.01 per GB, and Legacy
S3-RRS is around $0.024 per GB for the lowest band. Of the offered solutions
SS3 One-Zone-IA is the cheapest suitable option. Glacier cannot be considered
as it is not intended for direct access, however it comes in at around $0.004
per GB. Of course you spotted that RRS is being deprecated, and there is no
such thing as S3 – Provisioned IOPS. In this case OneZone


Question 30:

How many S3 buckets can I have per account by default?
    - 10
    - 20
    - 30
    - 50
    - 100   <--- the answer


Question 31:

You work for a busy digital marketing company who currently store their data
on-premise. They are looking to migrate to AWS S3 and to store their data in
buckets. Each bucket will be named after their individual customers, followed
by a random series of letters and numbers. Once written to S3 the data is
rarely changed, as it has already been sent to the end customer for them to use
as they see fit. However, on some occasions, customers may need certain files
updated quickly, and this may be for work that has been done months or even
years ago. You would need to be able to access this data immediately to make
changes in that case, but you must also keep your storage costs extremely low.
The data is not easily reproducible if lost. Which S3 storage class should you
choose to minimize costs and to maximize retrieval times?

    - S3
    - S3-IA         <--- answer
    - S3-1Zone-IA
    - Glacier
