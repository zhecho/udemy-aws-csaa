*******************************************************************************

    - Region is publicly location in the world
    - AZ (availability zone) - one or more discrete DCs witch with redundant
      power; networking / connectivity ... etc.

    - Edge location - endpoints for AWS which are used for caching
      content.Typically this consist of CloudFront , Amazon CDN (Content
      Delivery Network)

*******************************************************************************
*                  Section 3: IAM Identity Access Management                  *
*******************************************************************************
 IAM allows you to manage users and their rights to the AWS Console
    - centralised control
    - shared access to your AWS account
    - granular permission
    - identity federation (AD/facebook/linkedin...)
    - multifactor auth
    - provide temporary access
    - password rotation policy
    - integrates with many AWS services
    - PCI DSS Compliance

 Terminology
    - Users
    - Groups
    - Plicies   - json files with permissions for user/groups
    - Roles     - create rolea and assign it to AWS resources


****************
*  8. IAM Lab  *
****************
    - create user group via gui 
    - create S3_Admin_access Role and assign it to the user
    - create MFA with Auth app

    - IAM is universal

*  10. S3 (Simple Storage Service)  *
*************************************
 S3 - secure, durable, highly-scalable Object based storage 

 - S3 data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
 - object based
 - files can be between 0 and 5T
 - unlimited storage
 - files are stored in buckets
 - S3 is universal namespace (bucket names must be unique globally)
 - Example of S3: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucket_name>
 - when you upload a file to s3 successful your HTTP response code will be 200

 S3 Objects is consist of the following:
    - key       - name of the object
    - value     - data 
    - versionID - important for versioning 
    - metadata  - "data about data" ;)
    - sub resources:
        - ACL (access control list)
        - Torrents 

 Data Consistency Model for S3
    - Read after Write for PUTS of new objects
    - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time
      to propagate ) 

 S3 Guarantees:
    - build for 99.99$ Availability
    - Amazon guarantees 99.9% availability
    - Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (11x9)

 S3 Futures:
    - Tiered Storage Available
    - Lifecycle Management
    - Versioning
    - Encrypt 
    - MFA to Delete an object
    - ACL 

 S3 Classes:
    - S3 standard (99.99% availability / 11x9 - durability). Designed to
      sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
    - S3-IA (infrequently access) - lower fee than S3 but you are charged a
      retrieval fee.
    - S3 One Zone IA (formally known as RRS - reduce redundancy storage ) -for
      infrequently accessed data but you don't want multiple availability zones
      data resilience
    - S3 Intelligent Tiering - Designed to optimize costs by automatically to
      the most cost effective access tier without operational/performance
      impact (used for ML)
    - S3 Glacier - for data archiving. reliably store any data at costs that
      are competitive with or cheaper that on-premises solutions. Retrieval
      times configurable from minutes to hous
    - S3 Glacier Deep Archive - lowest cost storage class with retrieval times
      more than 12 hours

 S3 Charges:
    - per Storage
    - per Request
    - Storage management pricing 
    - Data Transfer Pricing
    - Transfer Acceleration
    - Cross Region Replication Pricing

NOTE: S3 is Not suitable for installing operating system or db :)) !!



*******************************
*  11. Let's Create S3 - Lab  *

************************************
*  12. S3 Security and Encryption  *
************************************
 By default all s3 buckets are Private. You can control access to s3 by
setting:
    - Bucket Policies
    - ACL
 Encryption in transit is secured by SSL/TLS protocols.
 Encryption at Rest (server side) is achieved by:
    - S3 Management Keys - SSE-S3 (service side encryption - s3)
    - AWS key management service - SSE-KMS
    - Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C 
 Client side encryption 
    - encrypt your file/object before upload it on s3

***********************
*  13. S3 Versioning  *
***********************
 - great backup tool
 - once enabled, versioning can't be disable only suspended
 - integrates with lifecycle rules
 - you can use MFA in order to Delete in a secure way.

******************************************
*  14. S3 Lifecycle Management - S3 Lab  *
******************************************
Create Lifecycle Rule with gui:
 S3 > bucket_name > Management > Lifecycle

With Lifecycle rules you can:
 - automates moving your storage to different storage tiers.
 - can be used in conjunction in versioning
 - can be applied to current version and previous versiosns

**********************************
*  15. Cross Region Replication  *
**********************************
Create replication:
 S3 > bucket_name > Management > Replication

 - CRR requires bucket versioning
 - regions must be unique
 - files in the existing bucket is not auto replicated, new ones does.
 - all subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
 - if you delete one file in the bucket the Replicated one is not deleted
   (delete markers are not replicated)
 - deleting individual versions or markers will not be replicated

**********************************
*  16. S3 Transfer Acceleration  *
**********************************

 - utilize CloudFront (AWS CDN) to accelerate your uploads to s3
 - check your speed to CloudFront to different regions with:
http://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html

*****************************
*  17. CloudFront Overview  *
*****************************
 AWS CDN (content delivery network) - distributed cache 

CloudFront - key terminology:
 - Edge Location - location that cache will be stored. This is separate to an
   AWS Region/AZ. You can use Edge Location to write it too!!!
 - Origin - origin of all objects stored in the CDN. They can be stored at: S3,
   bucket, EC2 Instance, Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53
 - Distribution - the name given the CDN which consist of a collection of Edge
   Locations
 - Web Distribution - used for websites
 - RTMP - used for media streaming
 - Objects are cached for a given time (TTL)

******************
*  19. Snowball  *
******************
 A petabyte-scale data transport solution.
 - 50TB and 80TB variants. It has 256-AES cryptography enabled
 - Snowball Edge is 100TB  data transfer device with onboard storage and
   compute capabilities.
 - Snowmobile - up to 100PB shipping container.

NOTE: Snowball can Import/Export from/to S3


*************************
*  21. Storage Gateway  *
*************************
 AWS Storage Gateway connects on-premises software appliances with cloud based
storage.
    - AWS SG can be installed on Vmware or Hyper-V in your DC
    - After activation you can use it from AWS Management Console

 Types of AWS Storage Gateway:
    - File Gateway      - NFS & SMB
    - Volume Gateway    - iSCSI
        - Stored volumes - store data in your DC locally but async backup via
          iSCSI to S3 in the form of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
        - Cached volumes - store frequently used data in your Storage GW 
    - Tape Gateway      - VTL
